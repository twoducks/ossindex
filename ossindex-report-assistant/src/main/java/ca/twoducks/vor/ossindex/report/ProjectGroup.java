/** Any single project may have several matched URIs (repositories). To explain, assume
 * we have three repositories A, B, and C, where each subsequent repository is cloned from
 * the previous.
 * 
 *    A -> B -> C
 * 
 * The report is configured against files that appear in project C, but project C only
 * changed one file, whereas project B changed one or more *different* files, and some
 * files in project A are unchanged by either B or C.
 * 
 * In this situation origin matching will provide projects A, B, and C as results.
 * 
 * It is important that we include all of these projects in the results, since vulnerabilities
 * and other interesting information may have been added at any one of these levels. For
 * this reason we provide a project GROUP which contains the projects. We treat them as
 * one, but can also work with them separately.
 * 
 * For now we group by name, which is imprecise but often sufficient.
